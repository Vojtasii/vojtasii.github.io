Hello everyone!

I'm writing this blog post and more coming in the next few weeks to document my progress in
the "Vývoj internetových aplikací (VIA)", or "Web application development", course at the Faculty
of Electrical Engineering at the Czech Technical University.

### Choosing a topic

The main task of the course is to create a web app of our choosing. There are only a few requirements
1. We must use three or more APIs
2. Two must be publicly accessible, one must be our own making
3. We must use an application server
4. We must provide [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation for our API
5. We must provide a link to our app here

I was not sure what kind of app I would like to make, but I really wanted to use some 
of the [Golemio](https://golemio.cz/) APIs. They are quite limited as of the time of writing, but
I wanted my focus to be on Prague, and they are easily accessible.

After not being able to figure out anything for a week, I finally had an idea the day of the deadline.
I sincerely apologise to our tutor for this, since I was not able to confirm the topic with him.
Hopefully, he'll forgive me, and it'll turn out alright.

The topic I've chosen is __Public transport racing__.
